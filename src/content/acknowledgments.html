<p>Thanks to the Gibraltar Point crew (Laurie, Sara, Janice, Becky, Lis, Michael, Dave, and Peter) who read this in zero draft and saved me from the most egregious errors. Steve Samenski caught a huge one. Those that remain are solely my responsibility.  Thanks to bladesmith Chris Doherty for research and advice, almost none of which ended up in the finished product. The story owes a debt to Alan Weisman&rsquo;s amazing <em>The World Without Us</em> for inspiration, and, of course, to David Byrne for the title.</p>
