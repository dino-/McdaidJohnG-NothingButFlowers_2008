<p>Author&rsquo;s note:</p>
<p>Actually, this one is not so much a story as an occasional fiction, written for a very specific audience, halfway between homage and pastiche and larded with sly winks and intertextual references. My plan after using it for its intended purpose was to make only the most cursory attempt at selling it (as one is obligated to, if one follows Heinlen&rsquo;s Five Rules ( http://www.nitrosyncretic.com/rah/rahfaq.html#0301 )) and then cc-license it, which is the only appropriate thing to do with something written as a wedding present for Cory Doctorow and Alice Taylor.</p>

<p>You can also read it at the website at http://www.torvex.com/jmcdaid/node/984 or download as rich text from http://torvex.com/jmcdaid/files/nothingbutflowers_jmcdaid.rtf</p>
